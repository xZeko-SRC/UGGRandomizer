# <H1> Untitled Goose Game Item Randomizer
This is melonloader mod for Untitled Goose Game.

# <H2> About
The Item Randomizer mod shuffles every item that the goose can hold in its beak, making the game more challenging by swapping items around. You can choose between a random seed or a deterministic seed, allowing another player to match your randomized item pattern.

# <H2> How to Install
Download MelonLoader from here.

Run the installer.

Select your Goose Game folder, typically located at:
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Untitled Goose Game```

Choose ```Untitled.exe``` and click 'Open.'
MelonLoader will automatically detect the version and architecture of your game.

Click 'Install' and wait for the process to complete.

Launch the game once to ensure everything is set up correctly with MelonLoader.

Once the game is closed, place UGGRandomizer.dll in the Mods folder inside the Goose Game directory:
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Untitled Goose Game\Mods```

Start the game, and the mod will load automatically.

# <H2> How to play
Start the game as usual, selecting either the yellow, green, or red book.

(Note: Erase the save if you're starting from scratch.)
Before honking, you'll see an input box for the seed number.

Enter any number for a seed. If you input '0', a random seed will be generated.

Only numbers are allowed; letters will not work.

After choosing a seed, click 'Submit Seed.' You can now honk and start playing!

If you quit or reset the game, items will revert to their original locations. To use the same pattern again, re-enter the seed.

To toggle the display of the generated seed number, press '3.'

To hide the Seed Input Menu while playing, press '2.'

Note: Submit the seed in the main game only, not in menus, to avoid breaking the mod.
